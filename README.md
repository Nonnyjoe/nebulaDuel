Nebula duel is built for persons that love the thrills and entertainment of the gaming world. Players get to purchase their favorite warriors, create duels or join already created ones. At the end of each duel, only one winner emerges.

**How to get started**

## Create profile

Players can create profiles seamlessly on the platform simply by connecting a wallet and then navigating to the `profile` page and passing in:
i. Name ( can be nickname ) <br/>
ii. Preferred avatar

Note that this process requires the player to sign a transaction, so wait for the wallet to pop up, then sign and wait for the transaction to be completed on-chain. <br/>
Upon a successful registration, 1000 points are minted to each player for use to purchase his/her preferred warriors.


## Buy warriors

Every player needs at least three warriors for the duels. Warriors are player characters with various attributes and qualities that are used for engaging in duels.
Every warrior has attributes: health, strength and attack in different degrees. The cost for each warrior is a reflection of the attributes it possesses. 

To purchase a warrior, go to your profile page, select the preferred warriors and then buy. **NOTE** Every player gets free 1000 points after profile creation to purchase characters, and when the 1000 points are exhausted the player can buy more points using the $nebular token.

Players can create new duel or join already created duels. To create a new duel:

i. Go to the homepage, click on PLAY NOW <br/>
